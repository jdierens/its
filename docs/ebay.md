# eBay seller connection

**Admin > Integrations > eBay** stores the seller connection only. Later steps will create listings from items, sync quantity, import orders into sales orders, and push tracking. Nothing in this step lists an item or reads orders.

Copy these into `.env.local`. They are server-only. Do not prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and do not commit the file.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` | App ID (client id) |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Cert ID (client secret) |
| `EBAY_RU_NAME` | RuName from the eBay developer portal. OAuth sends this as `redirect_uri`. |
| `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT` | `sandbox` or `production` |
| `EBAY_DEPLETION_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` | Token you choose for marketplace account deletion. 32 to 80 characters. |

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is also required. It is the only key that can read `ebay_connection`.

In the eBay developer portal, create a RuName whose **Auth Accepted URL** is:

`https://its-epks.vercel.app/api/ebay/callback`

Put that RuName in `EBAY_RU_NAME`. eBay does not use the URL itself as `redirect_uri`. Sandbox and production each have their own RuName. `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT` selects the hosts: `auth.ebay.com` and `api.ebay.com`, or `auth.sandbox.ebay.com` and `api.sandbox.ebay.com`.

Connect starts at `/api/ebay/connect`. The browser goes to eBay with a short-lived CSRF cookie and these scopes: `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope`, `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory`, `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account`, `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment`, `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.marketing`, and `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/commerce.identity.readonly`. The cookie is httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, and expires after 10 minutes. It is marked Secure in production. eBay returns to `/api/ebay/callback`, which checks the cookie with a constant-time compare. A mismatch shows "Connection could not be verified, please try Connect again" and is written to `ebay_sync_log`. The code is exchanged at `/identity/v1/oauth2/token` with HTTP Basic auth. ITS then calls the Commerce Identity `getUser` API and stores the eBay username and user id.

The access token lasts about two hours. ITS refreshes it with the long-lived refresh token when it is close to expiry. A sell API call that returns 401 is refreshed once and retried once. Token calls retry network errors, HTTP 429, and HTTP 5xx up to three times. `invalid_grant` and `invalid_client` are not retried. If the refresh token is past `refresh_expires_at`, or eBay returns `invalid_grant`, the connection is marked `needs_reconnect`. The card shows "eBay needs to be reconnected" and a Reconnect button. Errors in `ebay_sync_log` include `rlogid` and `X-EBAY-C-REQUEST-ID` when eBay sent them. Disconnect deletes the local tokens. eBay does not provide a revoke call for this flow, so the seller can also remove the app from their eBay account.

**Test connection** calls `sell/account/v1/privilege`, a read of selling privileges, and shows whether eBay accepted the token.

Production keysets must answer marketplace account deletion notifications. The endpoint is:

`https://its-epks.vercel.app/api/ebay/account-deletion`

Set the same URL and `EBAY_DEPLETION_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` in the eBay developer portal. A GET with `challenge_code` responds with `{ "challengeResponse": "<sha256 hex>" }`, where the hash is `challengeCode + verificationToken + endpoint` with no separator. A POST notification is acknowledged with HTTP 200 and a log line. ITS does not store the buyer username, user id, or eias token from that notification.

`/api/ebay/callback` and `/api/ebay/account-deletion` are in `PUBLIC_PATHS`. `/api/qbo/callback` is too. Those routes stay outside the session check. eBay's servers call the deletion endpoint with no session.

Vercel Deployment Protection still has to stay on. Sign-in does not lock the database: the anon key can still write the existing tables until the phase 2 policies in [sign-in](sign-in.md) are applied. eBay will not send a Vercel bypass header, so a protected deployment returns a login wall instead of the challenge JSON. That is unchanged. Turn Deployment Protection off only after phase 2 is deployed.

The Integrations card shows the accept URL and the deletion URL for the origin you are browsing. On production that is the two URLs above.
